	<p> Firstly, a couple of years ago: 5-6 - I started studying <a class="comments" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank"> C# </a> - I reached certain basic level of understanding - used as source for my studies the free ebook about C#, written by <a class="comments" href="https://nakov.com/about/" target="_blank"> Svetlin Nakov,</a> who at that time worked at <a class="comments" href="https://www.telerikacademy.com/" target="_blank"> Telerik </a>. I was at, approximately, 350<sup>th</sup> page from overall about 1200 pages (accompanied with a lot of exercises) - when I decided that this is not for me - "Why?": because the programming language was too complex, too much material to be studied, too little time and most importantly: the final products that could be created are more suitable for some more complex applications - and that's not my area that I wanted to dive in. </p>
	</li>	
	
	
	<li class="comments">
	<p> Secondly, I studied <a class="comments" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank"> Java </a> - at a course in <a class="comments" href="https://softuni.bg/" target="_blank"> Softuni </a> - "Why I started it when I have given up C# before?": it is related with strong personal determination for achieving career status in that time of my life - but at the end of the course - I came with the same conclusions that I have already made some years ago about C# - after all, the two programming languages are very similar (though different, they have many things in common).
	</p>
	</li>
	
	<li class="comments">
	<p> Then, briefly, I was at the 1st <a class="comments" href="https://creative.softuni.bg/" target="_blank"> Creative </a> course at Softuni. Very interesting material, still have my notes from the 1st lectures, but not an industry suitable for me - though I have my preferrals for the final outlook of a product - I tend to emphasize on the structure and the content. </p> 
	</li>
	
	<li class="comments">
	<p> Finally, after some deep consideration, thinking and research: I fully realized that I wanted to learn to create/develop websites, because I have always liked and heavily used the Internet and its concept of free reachable information and connection between people, companies, places, etc. So, for the last half year I was studying during my free time from work - but that was not enough. And, after my last work, I finally had the time and decided to complete my studies and to attend for a job position with the knowledge and skills I have gathered so far. </p>
